/* Find n-th term of series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21

Given a number n, find the nth term in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21…

Examples:

Input: n = 4 
Output: 10
Explanation: The 4th term of the Series is 10.
Input: n = 3 
Output: 6
Explanation: The 3rd term of the Series is 6.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104 */
