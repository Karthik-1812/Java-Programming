/* Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles.

If sum of angles is equal to 180, then triangle can be formed, else it can't be formed.

Input: 45 45 45

Expected Output: 

Triangle cannot be formed

Explanation -> We are getting 3 inputs, that is three angles of triangle, but here the sum of three angles that is 45+45+45 is not equal to 180 so Triangle cannot be formed is the output*/

// CODING:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int c=sc.nextInt();
        if(a+b+c==180){
            System.out.println("Triangle is formed");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Triangle cannot be formed");
        }
    }
}
