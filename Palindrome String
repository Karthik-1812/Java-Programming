/* Palindrome String

You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
Input: s = "acbca"
Output: true
Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 106
The string s contains only lowercase letters (a-z). */

class Solution {
    boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int i=0,j=s.length()-1;
        while(i<j){
            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)){
               return false;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
