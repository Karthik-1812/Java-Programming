Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 35.55%Submissions: 8K+Points: 1
Given a number N.Find the sum of fifth powers of natural numbers till N i.e. 15+25+35+..+N5.

Example 1:

Input:
N=2
Output:
33
Explanation:
The sum is calculated as 15+25=1+32=33.
Example 2:

Input:
N=3
Output:
276
Explanation:
The sum is calculated as 15+25+35
=1+32+243=276.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function sumOfFifthPowers() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns the sum of the fifth powers of Natural numbers till N.
